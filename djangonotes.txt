url.py: is the first file that is hit when user make request to your app

to create new app within projetc:
navigate into projetc
run: python manage.py startapp APPNAME

files within app created:
admin.py: there is built-in admin app that used for admin roles 
apps.py: it is the configuartion file for app itself, configuring classes
models.py: we will configuration for database. django automaticlay translates the written code into tabels and stuff 
test.py: usaually used for unit testing, 
views.py: handles request and response logic for web application 


Whenever we create new appp we have to tell our base project that app has been created 

going to views: what should happen when user made request is made, you define that in views.py 

importing HttpResponse for http requests 


steps:

2 goes in views make sure there is something server
3 then go urls and make sure you have path 
4 then go to project urls and make sure there is the path present for your app
